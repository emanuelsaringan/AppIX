            <h1>Free Fall Acceleration</h1>

            <p>
              Free fall refers to the motion of a falling body under the influence of gravity alone, no other external forces. Though air 
              drag can be a factor it can be considered as negligible depending upon the air column created. For example if you drop a 
              piece of paper at a height of half an inch, the paper is in free fall because air resistance is negated, but dropping it at 
              a height of 24 inches, the piece of paper is not in free fall anymore.
            </p>

            <p>
              Solving free fall problems is the same as solving problems of Uniformly Accelerated Motion; the only difference is that you 
              use acceleration due to gravity (g) instead of acceleration (a).
            </p>

            <p>
              Where g = 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              Meaning, an object freely falls with an acceleration of 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> only in Earth. Acceleration due to gravity may change
              depending upon the gravitational field of a certain object, let's say the moon, would have lesser gravitational force that 
              Earth because of lesser mass.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was once a tale about Galileo dropping two objects with different masses at the leaning tower of pisa, trying to prove that both would fall at the same rate because the acceleration of both objects are similar.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are three factors to know if an object is in free fall here on Earth:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                No other external forces are present rather than gravity
              </li>
              <li>
                Since a perfect vacuum is theoretical to be present in Earth, air resistance should be negligible in order to achieve 
                free fall.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is within the height lesser than the radius of the Earth.
              </li>
            </ol>
