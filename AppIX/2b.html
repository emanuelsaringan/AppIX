            <h3>Laws of Dry Friction</h3>

            <ul>
              <!--First Law-->
              <li>
                <strong>Amonton's First Law:</strong> The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load. 

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Suppose the stone had a greater mass (hence greater weight as g = constant). The stone would then: 
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      exert a greater force on the road (the increased load causes the separation distance of the nuclei to
                      decrease, force of repulsion becomes stronger (inverse-square law)), AND
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      More of the atoms of the road and the stone would be in contact. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <!--Second Law-->
              <li>
                <strong>Amonton's Second Law:</strong> The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact. 

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What this law means is that if two equal masses made of <em>similar material</em> are resting on the 
                    <em>same surface</em> with <em>different areas of contact</em>, they would require the <em>same amound of 
                    force</em> to start moving (overcome static friction) and to move at a constant speed. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To put it in another way: considering 2 equal masses and the area in contact in situation A is greater than in 
                    situation B. This only means that in situtation A, the load is distributed across a greater area than in 
                    situation B. However, the <em>applied load is still the same!</em> Thus to move both masses, we would require the 
                    same amount of applied force to overcome friction. (Amonton's First Law)
