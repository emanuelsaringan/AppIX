                  Example of scalar quantities are length, mass, speed, time, temperature, work, etc.

                <li>
                  Scalar quantities are solved through the use basic arithmetic.

                Problem involving scalars:
              </p>

              <p>
                A man travelling in foot, travelled a distance of 1000 m going to his house, as he reached his house he just remembered that he had left his keys from his starting point, making him travel back again to get the keys then return again to his house. What was the total distance travelled by the man?
              </p>

              <p>
                1<sup>st</sup> walk = 1000 m
              </p>

              <p>
                But he forgot his keys so he travels back again a distance of 1000 m
              </p>

              <p>
                2<sup>nd</sup> walk = 1000 m
              </p>

              <p>
                After getting the keys, travels back again to his house
              </p>

              <p>
                3<sup>rd</sup> walk = 1000 m
              </p>

              <p>
                DT = 1000 m + 1000 m + 1000 m = 3000 m
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Examples of scalar quantities are displacement, velocity, force, torque, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One way of solving vectors is using the analytical/ component method.
