            <p>
              For thousands of years, people thought that when an object moves, it will eventually stop, and if you want to keep
              the object moving, you must constantly apply force. There's nothing wrong with it, it's what we see in our daily lives. But
              during the 1600s 3 people theorized that it might be the other way around. That objects are constantly moving unless you 
              apply an unbalanced force upon it. 
            </p>

            <p>
              But that doesn't fit right, we always see things move and stop by itself. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Maybe because it itself doesn't stop, because even though we're leaving and object to move by itself, there is still a net
              force being applied to it, and that is the force of friction. 
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If the net force on a body is zero, its velocity will not change
              </li>

              <li>
                An unbalanced force cannot always change the object's direction. 
              </li>
            </ul>
