            <h1>First Law of Motion</h1>
            <h3>Law of Inertia</h3>

            <p>
              For thousands of years, people thought that when an object moves, it will eventually stop, and if you want to keep
              the object moving, you must constantly apply force. There's nothing wrong with it, it's what we see in our daily lives. But
              during the 1600s 3 people theorized that it might be the other way around. That objects are constantly moving unless you 
              apply an unbalanced force upon it. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Imagine a ball lying on the floor not moving at all, a ball at rest. The ball will always stay at rest as long as
              there is no external force applied to it, let's say for example a kick. If someone kicks the ball or applies a force to
              it, it starts to roll or change its state of motion because the kick served as an unbalanced force which changed the net force of
              the ball, thus causing it to move.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              An object at rest will always stay at rest as long as there is no unbalanced force acting on it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              But that doesn't fit right, we always see things move and stop by itself. For example, a toy car moving in a carpet then after some time
              it suddenly stops.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maybe because it itself doesn't stop, because even though we're leaving an object to move by itself, there is still a net
              force being applied to it, and that is the force of friction. 
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If the net force on a body is zero, its velocity will not change
              </li>

              <li>
                An unbalanced force cannot always change the object's direction. 
              </li>
            </ul>
