            <h1>What is Physics?</h1>
            <p>
              Physics is defined as the science that deals with matter, energy, motion, and force.
            </p>

            <p>
              From the tiny atoms that build you to the vast universe that amazes you, it encompasses the large and small, the old 
              and new. Physics is everywhere, from the moment you were born until the time you grow old, physics is always there. 
              Physics is innate within us.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we were young, we have seen how things move, we are able to move things by applying force, and we have the capacity to 
              sense heat and cold, and see colors and light. Physics is able to explain such phenomena, through the magnificent equations 
              and the inevitable laws that Physics has defined, we are able to grasp and perceive clearly the universe that we are 
              stepping in.

                The legendary Archimedes one of the greatest scientists during the ancient times, remembered as the proponent of the
                gargantuan claw designed to impale ships and used shields as heat rays in order to ignite a fleet.  He is known for his
                bath tub epiphany where he discovered the power of buoyancy which was later named after him, "Archimedes Principle" which
                explained why some objects float and why others do not, he also made simple machines such as screws and levers. He also
                contributed knowledge to the field of mathematics especially in geometry.

                The great Isaac Newton, his ideas shocked the world of science. The founder of differential calculus, formalized the laws of motion, and
                built the law of universal gravitation. His contribution to the field of physics opened a new era of advancement, it gave birth to another
                way of understanding how the universe works and enlightened us more on the movement of celestial bodies. This genius also contributed to the
                field of optics, in understanding the properties of light. Newton is considered as one of the greatest physicists that ever lived.

                The famous Albert Einstein, the man who introduced the mind-blowing theory of relativity which later changed our view to 
                objects moving at velocities that are equal to the speed of light. He also discovered the photoelectric effect that 
                helped us understand the structure of light. Other than that he built the famous equation E=MC<sup>2</sup>, where mass can be
                converted in energy, vice versa.  His theories were essential for paving the way to technological advancement.
