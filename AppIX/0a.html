            <h1>What is Physics?</h1>
            <p>
              Physics is defines as the science that deals with matter, energy, motion, and force.
            </p>

            <p>
              From the tiny atoms that build you to the vast universe that amazes you, it encompasses the large and small, the old 
              and new. Physics is everywhere, from the moment you were born until the time you grow old, physics is always there. 
              Physics is innate within us.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we were young, we have seen how things move, we are able to move things by applying force, and we have the capacity to 
              sense heat and cold, and see colors and light. Physics is able to explain such phenomena, through the magnificent equations 
              and the inevitable laws that Physics has defined, we are able to grasp and perceive clearly the universe that we are 
              stepping in.

              Some of the Pioneers of Physics:

            <dl>
              <dt>
                Archimedes
              </dt>
              <dd>
                The legendary Archimedes remembered as the proponent of the gargantuan claw used to impale a ship and to 
                use shields as heat rays to ignite a fleet.  He is known for his bath tub epiphany where he discovered the power of 
                buoyancy which was later named after him, "Archimedes Principle" which explains why some objects float and why others do 
                not, he also made simple machines such as screws and levers. He also contributed knowledge to the field of mathematics 
                especially in geometry. 
              </dd>

              <br/>

              <dt>
                Isaac Newton
              </dt>
              <dd>
                The great Isaac Newton, famous for his three laws of motion, which will be discussed in the later topics, and his apple 
                dilemma which later changed the world's view of the universe. Just by simply asking, "Why does an apple fall?" Became the 
                spark of the invention of differential calculus to be then after some time, the law of universal gravitation. Other than 
                that Newton also contributed knowledge to the field of optics. Newton is considered as one of the greatest physicists of 
                all time due to his legacy and contributions to the scientific world.

              <dt>
                Albert Einstein
              </dt>
              <dd>
                The famous Albert Einstein, the man who introduced the mind-blowing theory of relativity which later changed our view to 
                objects moving at velocities that are equal to the speed of light. He also discovered the photoelectric effect that 
                helped us understand the structure of light. Other than that he built his famous equation E=MC<sup>2</sup>, where mass can be
                converted in energy, vice versa.  His theories were essential for paving the way to technological advancement.
