      <h1>Third Law of Motion</h1>
      <h3>Law of Action-Reaction</h3>

      <p>
        When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and
        opposite in direction to that of the first body. This law is sometimes referred to as the <em>action-reaction law</em>,
        with <strong>F</strong><sub>A</sub> called the "action" and <strong>F</strong><sub>B</sub> the "reaction". The action and 
        the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the <em>action</em> and which is called the
        <em>reaction;</em> both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.

      <h3>Equilibrium of Forces:</h3>

      <p>
        A resultant force would cause a stationary object to start moving or an object moving with a given velocity to speed up or 
        slow down or change dircation such that the velocity of the object changes. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, for stationary objects or objects moving with constant velocity, the resultant force acting on the object is
        zero. The object is said to be in <strong>equilibrium</strong>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If a resultant force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional force 
        that exactly balances this resultant. Such a force is called the <em>equilibrant</em> and is equal in magnitude but 
        opposite in direction to the original resultant force acting on the object. 
      </p>

      <pre>Definition: The equilibrant of any number of forces is the single force required to produce the equilibrium.</pre>
