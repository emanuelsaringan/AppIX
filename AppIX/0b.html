          <h1>Measurement</h1>
          <p>
            Mathematics play a very large role in the life of physics, just imagine that they were couples, you can never separate the 
            two. Let's try measuring the number of heartbeats you have in a day.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            How many heartbeats do you have in a day?
          </p>
          
          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="heartbeet.gif" class="img-long"></img>
          </div>

          <br/>
          
          <p>
            Let's say in 1 minute you have approximately 70 heartbeats.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then that would be 70 hearbeats/minute
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Convert minutes into hours:

          </math>

          <p>
            The heart beats 98 832 times a day, approximately 100 000 times a day.

            You maybe wondering right now what's the connection of this to physics... well measurement plays a very large role in physics. For example, if you want to measure the mass of the Earth, you can't hang the Earth on a weighing scale then measure the same goes with the heartbeat you won't count the beats of your heart the whole day. Physics gives us a lot of options to solve life's daily problems. Every physical phenomena can be describe mathematically, that's why the beauty of physics lies on the magnificent numbers which gives nature a touch of mathematical art.

          <p>
            Well, that's just a sneak peek at the cake box; weâ€™re not yet on the cake itself. The first thing that you should know is basic measurement, once were done with this we can continue our journey into the first part of physics, which is mechanics.

          <h3>SI Units</h3>
          <p>
            The International System of Units (Systeme Internationale) which is the standard base units for measurement, it uses meter, 
            kilogram, kelvin, etc. Another system of measurement is the English System which uses miles, pound, etc. 
          </p>

          <p>
            But for generality and comfort, SI units will be used in the whole course because it is easier to manipulate for it is 
            expressed in the powers of 10.
