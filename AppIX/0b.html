            <h1>Measurement</h1>
            <p>
              Mathematics play a very large role in the life of physics, just imagine that they were couples, you can never separate the 
              two. All the laws and theories that you are about to encounter has its own specific equation that is expressed 
              mathematically. Other than that, physics also deals with a lot of measurements. Every law and theory is proved by empirical 
              data that is made through experiment, and data requires measurement. For example, you want to calculate how many heartbeats 
              do you beat in on day? *solution*
            </p>

            <p>
              Well, that's just a sneak peek at the cake box; weâ€™re not yet on the cake itself. The first thing that you should know is basic measurement, once were done with this we can journey into the world of exciting topics and fun physics problems.
            </p>

            <h3>SI Units</h3>
            <p>
              The International System of Units (Systeme Internationale) which is the standard base units for measurement, it uses meter, 
              kilogram, kelvin, etc. Another system of measurement is the English System which uses miles, pound, etc. 
            </p>

            <p>
              But for generality and comfort, SI units will be used in the whole course because it is easier to manipulate for it is 
              expressed in the powers of 10.

                The exact of definition of length is the distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 
                second.
              </li>

              <li>
                The exact of definition of mass is the mass of specific platinum-iridium allow.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                Time is exactly defined as 9,192,631,700 time the period of oscillation of radiation from the cesium atom.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These things accounts as the basis for each measurement in the SI system.
