            <h1>Coefficient of Friction</h1>

            <p>
              Coefficient of Friction is a dimensionless scalar value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between
              two bodies and the force pressing them together. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used; for
              example, ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction. 
              Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one.

                <strong>Coulomb's Law of Friction: </strong> Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity. 

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The law states that for two dry solid surfaces sliding against one another, the magnitude of the kinetic friction
                    exerted through the surface is independent of the magnitude of the velocity (i.e. the speed) of the slipping of the
                    surfaces against each other. 
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Note that the <em>direction</em> of the kinetic friction does depend on the <em>direction</em> of the velocity -- it 
                    is precisely the opposite direction.
