          What is motion?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Motion is simply a change in an object's position. For example, walking or running along the street is motion. Push 
          objects, you change their position, then you make them move. 
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        The simplest type of motion is <em>linear motion</em> because it only considers a straight path.
        Just like this:
      </p>

      <div class="text-center">
        <img src="straight.tiff" alt="Straight Path"></img>
      </div>
      
      <br/>
      
      <p>
        There are also curve paths, for example the orbit that the planets take during revolution, that is one example of a curved path. A car driving
        in an elliptical road travels also on a curve path. Kinematics in a curved motion will not be dealt in this course, only objects in
        one-dimensional motion.
