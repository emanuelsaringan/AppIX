            <h1>Friction</h1>

            <p>
              It is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each 
              other. When surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the two surfaces converts kinetic energy
              into heat. Friction is not itself a fundamental force but arises from fundamental electromagnetic forces between the charged
              particles constituting the two contacting surfaces.
