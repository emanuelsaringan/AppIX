            <p>
              The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as the net force acting on the body
              and inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, <strong>F</strong> = <em>m</em><strong>a</strong>, where <strong>F</strong>
              is the net force acting on the object, <em>m</em> is the mass of the object and <strong>a</strong> is the acceleration of
              the object.
