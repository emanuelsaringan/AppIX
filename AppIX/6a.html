            <h1>Law of Universal Gravitation</h1>
            <p>
              You throw a ball up, it will come down and the force which pulls objects down is the force of gravity.

              A law formulated by Isaac Newton in 1687 which states that two object with masses m1and m2 are separated by a distance r, a 
              gravitational force F acts along a line joining them, with magnitude given by

                Gravity is a force that attracts.

                Anything that has mass has gravity. Even you have gravity, it's just that it's so small that you are not able to feel it; 
                you need to have a mass similar to a planet in order to strengthen your gravity.

              Weight vs. Mass
            </h3>

            <p>
              The term weight that we use in our daily basis is not the same as the physics definition of weight. Most people define 
              weight as the same as mass, but physics defines weight as the product of the mass of the object and the gravity exerted 
              upon it.

              However mass is,

            <p>
              Weight is measured in Newtons and requires gravity while mass is in Kilograms and only needs the object itself.
